                 'FrontEnd Plus' The GUI for the fast JAva Decompiler.
                                 Version 2.00 BETA 
              [Starting to Work on this project again after a long break]

PLEASE NOTE: This software now asks you to register, I DO NOT want anything from you..
             But I would like to know just how many of you out there are using this 
             product I'm working on. It's is for my own records only and do not ever
             plan to make this software sharware. It sort of gives me encouragement
             to continue building this project, and thats all.

PLEASE NOTE: This software is now beginning to take shape of some sort BUT WILL still
             have a few bugs hidden in there no doubt, this is why it's a Beta :)
             But I will continue to improve it over a course of time and will also
             add useful suggestions as time goes on. 

PLEASE NOTE: This version now supports JDK, Although only simple compile operations
             are available at this present time. Also note error checking is NOT yet Implemented
	     in this feature, so your on your own for the time being.

FINAL NOTE:  Remember this program MUST be in the same directory as JAD.EXE

             'FrontEnd' should be placed into the same directory as you installed JAD.EXE.
so, if you have installed (JAD the fast JAva Decompiler) into say; C:\JAD then you will need
to place FrontEnd.exe also into C:\JAD.

             This is basically the install procedure complete. You can also add a Desktop
Icon if you so wish.
